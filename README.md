# ENSIAME BOX

This project consists on the development and improvement of the ENSIAME BOX, worked by previous ENSIAME students in 
previous years (Favre et al. 2016; Cruz, 2018).

It consists of a pedagogic tool combining software and hardware aspects used to apply quizzes and voting polls, 
such as other scholar applications in which various users or multiple answers are needed.
